# 🧠 Key Takeaway

* **Traditional mindset** → Layered / Monolith
* **Best practice today** → Clean Architecture (+ CQRS if needed)
* **Most modern & flexible** → Vertical Slice
* **Enterprise scale** → Microservices

---

# Q: Should we use class library projects? or just normal folders?

Great question—this is one of the **most important architectural decisions** in .NET projects, and there’s no one-size-fits-all rule. The key is to balance **simplicity vs. boundaries**.

Let’s break it down in a practical way 👇

---

# 🧠 Core Principle

> Use a **separate project** when you need a *strong boundary*.
> Use a **folder** when you just need *organization*.

---

# ⚖️ Decision Table

| Question                                     | If YES → Use Separate Project | If NO → Use Folder |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Does it have its own responsibility/domain?  | ✅                             | ❌                  |
| Will it be reused in other apps/services?    | ✅                             | ❌                  |
| Do you want strict dependency control?       | ✅                             | ❌                  |
| Does it change independently from others?    | ✅                             | ❌                  |
| Does it need separate testing or deployment? | ✅                             | ❌                  |
| Is the project getting too large/complex?    | ✅                             | ❌                  |

---

# 📦 When to Use a **Separate Project**

### ✅ Use it when the module is:

* A **core domain** (e.g., Orders, Payments, Identity)
* A **shared library** (used across solutions)
* An **infrastructure concern** (DB, external APIs)
* A **different layer** (Domain, Application, Infrastructure)

### 💡 Example (Clean Architecture)

```bash
Solution
 ├── MyApp.Domain          ← separate project
 ├── MyApp.Application     ← separate project
 ├── MyApp.Infrastructure  ← separate project
 └── MyApp.API             ← separate project
```

👉 Why?
Because you want **strict boundaries and dependency direction**.

---

# 📁 When to Use a **Folder**

### ✅ Use it when the module is:

* Just a **feature grouping**
* Not reused outside the app
* Tightly coupled to the app
* Small/simple

### 💡 Example (Vertical Slice)

```bash
Features
 ├── Orders
 │    ├── CreateOrder.cs
 │    ├── GetOrder.cs
 │    └── OrderValidator.cs
 ├── Users
 └── Products
```

👉 Why?
Because splitting into projects here would add **unnecessary complexity**.

---

# 🚨 Common Mistake

> ❌ Creating too many projects too early

This leads to:

* Slower builds
* Painful dependency management
* Over-engineering

👉 Start with folders → extract to projects when needed.

---

# 🔥 A Practical Rule (Very Useful)

### Start like this:

* Use **folders by default**

### Then promote to project when:

* 🔁 You need reuse
* 🔒 You need strict boundaries
* 🧪 You want isolated testing
* 📦 It becomes logically independent

---

# 🧩 Real-World Example Evolution

### 🟢 Early Stage

```bash
/Features
/Services
/Data
```

### 🟡 Growing App

```bash
/Features
/Infrastructure
/Shared
```

### 🔴 Mature App

```bash
MyApp.Domain
MyApp.Application
MyApp.Infrastructure
MyApp.API
```

---

# 🧠 Mental Model

Think of it like this:

* **Folder = Room inside a house**
* **Project = Separate building**

👉 Don’t build a new building unless you really need one.

---

# 💡 My Recommendation

* Small/medium apps → **Folders (Vertical Slice style)**
* Large/enterprise apps → **Projects (Clean Architecture layers)**
* Unsure? → Start simple, **refactor later**

---


# Pros, Cons, and Sclae

* ✅ **Pros**
* ❌ **Cons**
* 📈 **How it scales (in practice)**

---

# 🧱 1. Layered Architecture (N-Tier)

### ✅ Pros

* Very easy to understand and implement
* Clear separation (UI → Business → Data)
* Works well for CRUD applications

### ❌ Cons

* Layers become tightly coupled over time
* Business logic leaks into other layers
* Hard to test independently

### 📈 Scaling

* **Vertical scaling (easy):** Increase server resources
* **Horizontal scaling (limited):** Entire app scales together
* **Problem:** You cannot scale only one part (e.g., DB-heavy logic)

👉 Typically becomes a **bottleneck** as the app grows.

---

# 🧅 2. Clean Architecture

### ✅ Pros

* Strong separation of concerns
* Highly testable (domain is isolated)
* Framework-independent (easy to swap DB/UI)
* Long-term maintainability

### ❌ Cons

* More boilerplate code
* Requires discipline and experience
* Slower to start

### 📈 Scaling

* **Vertical scaling:** Works well
* **Horizontal scaling:** Good (stateless APIs)
* **Modular scaling:** You can extract features into microservices later

👉 Excellent for **evolving systems**—you can grow without rewriting.

---

# 🧩 3. Onion Architecture

*(Very similar to Clean, slightly different naming)*

### ✅ Pros

* Domain-centric design
* Decoupled infrastructure
* Easy unit testing

### ❌ Cons

* Abstract for beginners
* Can become over-engineered

### 📈 Scaling

* Same as Clean Architecture:

  * Easy to split into services later
  * Works well with dependency injection
  * Supports modular growth

👉 Think of it as **Clean Architecture with a stricter domain focus**.

---

# 🧠 4. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

### ✅ Pros

* Separates reads and writes → better performance
* Optimized queries (read models tailored for UI)
* Handles complex domains well

### ❌ Cons

* High complexity
* Data duplication (read vs write models)
* Eventual consistency issues

### 📈 Scaling

* **Read scaling:** Extremely good (scale queries independently)
* **Write scaling:** Independent scaling possible
* Can use:

  * Read replicas
  * Caching layers
  * Event-driven systems

👉 Ideal for:

* High-traffic systems
* Systems with heavy reads (e.g., dashboards)

---

# 🔌 5. Microservices Architecture

### ✅ Pros

* Independent services
* Independent deployments
* Fault isolation
* Technology flexibility

### ❌ Cons

* Distributed system complexity
* Network latency
* Hard debugging
* Requires DevOps maturity

### 📈 Scaling

* **Best scalability model available:**

  * Scale each service independently
  * Deploy services separately
  * Use containers (Docker/Kubernetes)

👉 Example:

* Scale **OrderService** only during high traffic
* Leave others untouched

⚠️ But comes with operational overhead.

---

# 🧱 6. Monolithic Architecture

### ✅ Pros

* Very simple to build and deploy
* Everything in one place
* Easy debugging

### ❌ Cons

* Becomes tightly coupled
* Hard to maintain as code grows
* Slow deployments

### 📈 Scaling

* **Vertical scaling:** Easy
* **Horizontal scaling:** Possible but inefficient
* Must scale the **entire app**, not parts

👉 Often evolves into:

* “Big ball of mud” if not structured well

---

# 🧬 7. Vertical Slice Architecture

### ✅ Pros

* Feature-based organization
* Very modular
* Minimal coupling between features
* Works great with MediatR

### ❌ Cons

* Less familiar to many developers
* Can duplicate logic if not careful

### 📈 Scaling

* **Feature-level scaling (logical):**

  * Each feature is isolated
* Easy transition to:

  * Microservices (split by feature)

👉 Combines:

* Clean Architecture benefits
* With better **developer productivity**

---

# ⚖️ Scaling Comparison Summary

| Architecture   | Scaling Type         | Scalability Level | Notes                 |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Layered        | Vertical             | ⭐⭐ Low-Medium     | Becomes bottleneck    |
| Clean          | Modular + Horizontal | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High         | Future-proof          |
| Onion          | Modular              | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High         | Similar to Clean      |
| CQRS           | Read/Write split     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very High   | Great for performance |
| Microservices  | Distributed          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent   | Most scalable         |
| Monolithic     | Vertical             | ⭐⭐ Low-Medium     | Hard to grow          |
| Vertical Slice | Feature-based        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High         | Easy to evolve        |

---

# 🧠 Final Insight

* **If you expect growth → avoid plain layered/monolith**
* **If you want long-term maintainability → Clean / Onion**
* **If you expect heavy traffic → CQRS or Microservices**
* **If you want modern simplicity → Vertical Slice**

# 🧩 2. Inside a Module (Orders)

Each module is **a mini Clean Architecture**:

```text id="orders-module-structure"
Modules

      ├── Domain
      │    ├── Entities
      │    │    └── Order.cs

           ├── Controllers
           │    └── OrdersController.cs
           └── DependencyInjection.cs
```

---

# 🧱 3. BuildingBlocks (Shared Kernel)

These are **shared but controlled carefully**:

```text id="building-blocks-structure"
BuildingBlocks
 ├── Domain
 │    ├── BaseEntity.cs
 │    ├── IAggregateRoot.cs
 │    └── IDomainEvent.cs

 ├── Application
 │    ├── Interfaces
 │    │    └── ICommand.cs
 │    ├── Behaviors (MediatR pipeline)
 │    └── Exceptions

 ├── Infrastructure
 │    ├── Messaging
 │    ├── Logging
 │    └── Caching

 └── Contracts
      ├── Events
      │    └── OrderCreatedIntegrationEvent.cs
      └── DTOs
```

---

# 🔗 4. How Modules Communicate

### ❌ NOT allowed:

```csharp
_userService.GetUser(); // direct call ❌
```

---

### ✅ Allowed approaches:

#### 1. Via Interfaces (inside same monolith)

```csharp
IUserService.GetUser();
```

#### 2. Via Domain Events

```text id="domain-event-flow"
OrderCreatedEvent → handled by Payments module
```

#### 3. Via Integration Events (future microservices)

```text id="integration-event-flow"
OrderCreatedIntegrationEvent → Message Broker → PaymentService
```

---

# 🧠 5. Dependency Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

Inside each module:

```text id="dependency-direction"
Domain ← Application ← Infrastructure ← API
```

### Rules:

* Domain knows NOTHING about other layers
* Application depends only on Domain
* Infrastructure implements interfaces
* API depends on everything

---

# 🚀 6. Registration (Dependency Injection)

Each module is plug-and-play:

```csharp id="module-registration"
builder.Services.AddOrdersModule();
builder.Services.AddUsersModule();
builder.Services.AddPaymentsModule();
```

👉 This makes it easy to:

* Remove a module
* Extract it later

---

# 🔄 7. How This Becomes Microservices Later

You can literally extract like this:

```text id="microservice-extraction"
Before:
 └── Monolith
      ├── Orders
      ├── Users

After:
 ├── OrderService (copied Orders module)
 ├── UserService
 └── API Gateway
```

Minimal changes needed ✅

---

# ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ 1. Shared Database Across Modules

* Breaks modularity

### ❌ 2. Shared Models Everywhere

* Causes tight coupling

### ❌ 3. Direct Module-to-Module Calls

* Kills scalability

### ❌ 4. Putting Everything in “Application”

* Becomes a dumping ground

---

# 💡 Pro Tips

* Use **MediatR** for commands/queries
* Keep modules **feature-focused**
* Prefer **events over direct calls**
* Think: *“Can I extract this module tomorrow?”*

---

# 🎯 Final Mental Model

```text id="final-mental-model"
[ Modular Monolith ]
        +
[ Clean Architecture per module ]
        +
[ Event-driven communication ]
```

---

# 🔥 One-line takeaway

> Structure your monolith like microservices from day one—
> then splitting it later becomes a **copy-paste operation, not a rewrite**.
