```
Is table very large?
  ↓
YES
  ↓
Do queries filter by a column (e.g., date)?
  ↓
YES → Use partitioning
  ↓
NO → Consider sharding
```

---

# 🔎 Search-Specific Problem

```

  ↓
YES → Use Elasticsearch
```

---

# ⚡ Simplified Mental Flow (Interview Version)

1. **Check execution plan**
2. **Fix indexes**
3. **Reduce scanned data**
4. **Optimize joins**
5. **Precompute (materialized views / columnstore)**
6. **Cache results**
7. **Scale reads (replicas)**
8. **Split data (partitioning)**
9. **Scale writes (sharding)**

---

# 🧠 Key Insight (Most Important Rule)

👉 **Never jump to sharding or replicas first**
Always go in this order:

**Query → Index → Data → Cache → Scale**

---

# ✅ Real-World Example Walkthrough

**Problem:** Dashboard query is slow

Flow:

1. EXPLAIN → full table scan
2. Add index ✅
3. Still slow → aggregation heavy
4. Add materialized view ✅
5. Traffic grows → DB CPU high
6. Add read replicas ✅
7. Still heavy → add Redis caching ✅

Great question — this is exactly where people level up in performance tuning. Execution plans can look overwhelming, but once you understand the **operators**, everything becomes much clearer.

Here’s a **comprehensive table of the most important execution plan operators**, what they mean, when they appear, and whether they’re good or bad.

---

# 📊 Execution Plan Operators Explained

## 🔍 Access Methods (How data is read)

| Operator                     | What It Means                              | When It Happens                         | Good or Bad         | Notes                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Table Scan**               | Reads entire table                         | No index OR optimizer chooses full scan | ❌ Usually bad       | OK only for very small tables          |
| **Index Scan**               | Reads entire index                         | Index exists but not selective enough   | ⚠️ Medium           | Better than table scan but still heavy |
| **Index Seek**               | Directly jumps to matching rows            | Proper index + selective filter         | ✅ Best              | What you usually want                  |
| **Clustered Index Scan**     | Scans full table (since clustered = table) | No good filter on clustered key         | ❌ Bad               | Same as table scan logically           |
| **Clustered Index Seek**     | Seeks using primary key                    | Query filters on clustered key          | ✅ Excellent         | Fastest access                         |
| **Non-Clustered Index Scan** | Scans secondary index                      | Index exists but not selective          | ⚠️ Medium           | Might still scan many rows             |
| **Non-Clustered Index Seek** | Uses secondary index efficiently           | Filter matches index                    | ✅ Good              | Often followed by Key Lookup           |
| **Key Lookup (RID Lookup)**  | Fetches missing columns from table         | Index doesn't cover query               | ⚠️ Can be expensive | Fix with covering index                |

---

## 🔗 Join Operators (How tables are combined)

| Operator                   | What It Means                              | When It Happens               | Good or Bad           | Notes                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Nested Loops Join**      | Loops through one table and probes another | Small dataset OR indexed join | ✅ Good for small data | Becomes slow with large data |
| **Hash Match (Hash Join)** | Builds hash table in memory                | Large datasets, no indexes    | ⚠️ Medium             | Memory-heavy but scalable    |
| **Merge Join**             | Joins sorted datasets                      | Both inputs sorted/indexed    | ✅ Very fast           | Requires sorted inputs       |

---

## 📊 Aggregation Operators

| Operator             | What It Means                | When It Happens      | Good or Bad | Notes            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| **Stream Aggregate** | Aggregates sorted data       | Input already sorted | ✅ Efficient | Preferred        |
| **Hash Aggregate**   | Uses hash table for grouping | Unsorted large data  | ⚠️ Medium   | Uses more memory |

---

## 🔄 Sorting & Filtering

| Operator   | What It Means           | When It Happens                   | Good or Bad | Notes                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| **Sort**   | Sorts result set        | ORDER BY / GROUP BY without index | ❌ Expensive | Avoid with proper index  |
| **Filter** | Applies WHERE condition | After data retrieval              | ⚠️ Neutral  | Better to filter earlier |

---

## 🔁 Data Movement / Intermediate

| Operator                      | What It Means           | When It Happens            | Good or Bad         | Notes                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Compute Scalar**            | Computes expressions    | Calculations, functions    | ✅ Cheap             | Usually harmless        |
| **Concatenation**             | Combines result sets    | UNION ALL                  | ✅ Fine              | Lightweight             |
| **Spool (Table/Index Spool)** | Temporary storage       | Reuse intermediate results | ⚠️ Can be expensive | Indicates repeated work |
| **Parallelism**               | Splits work across CPUs | Large queries              | ✅ Good              | Watch for overhead      |

---

## ⚠️ Warning Signs (Red Flags)

| Operator                | Why It's Bad         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| Table Scan              | Reads entire table   |
| Clustered Index Scan    | Same as table scan   |
| Key Lookup (many times) | Causes repeated I/O  |
| Sort (large data)       | Expensive memory/CPU |
| Hash Match (huge data)  | Memory spill risk    |
| Spool                   | Hidden repeated work |

---

# 🧭 Quick Interpretation Cheat Sheet

## If you see:

### 🔴 Table Scan

→ Missing index → **Add index**

---

### 🟡 Index Scan

→ Index exists but inefficient
→ **Improve selectivity / composite index**

---

### 🟢 Index Seek

→ ✅ Good — leave it

---

### 🔴 Key Lookup (many times)

→ **Create covering index**

---

### 🔴 Nested Loop + Large Rows

→ Bad choice →
→ Try **Hash Join or better indexing**

---

### 🔴 Sort Operator

→ Add index for ORDER BY

---

### 🔴 Hash Match with spills

→ Memory issue →
→ Add index or reduce dataset

---

# 🧠 How to Read a Plan (Simple Method)

1. Start from **right to left** (data flow)
2. Look for:

   * Biggest cost operators
   * Scans vs seeks
3. Ask:

   * Can I reduce rows earlier?
   * Can I avoid this operator?

---

# ⚡ Example Mental Mapping

| You See          | You Think                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Table Scan       | “I need an index”           |
| Key Lookup       | “I need covering index”     |
| Sort             | “I need index for ORDER BY” |
| Hash Join        | “No index on join”          |
| Nested Loop slow | “Too many rows”             |

---

# ✅ Final Insight

Execution plans answer one question:

👉 **“How is the database actually executing my query?”**

Once you map operators to problems:

* Scans → indexing issue
* Joins → data size/index issue
* Sorts → missing index
* Lookups → incomplete index
