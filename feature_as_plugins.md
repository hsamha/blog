## Features as Plugins in ASP.NET Core

**ASP.NET Core** is actually a very solid platform for building a **plugin-based, per-client feature system**. 

---

# 🧩 1. Goal: “Features per client” (multi-tenant plugins)

You want:

* Client A → Feature X + Y
* Client B → Feature Y + Z
* Features are **pluggable modules**

This is essentially:
👉 **Plugin Architecture + Feature Flags + Multi-tenancy**

---

# 🏗️ 2. High-Level Structure (ASP.NET Core)

```id="asp1"

├── Core/
│   ├── Abstractions/
│   │   └── IPlugin.cs
│   │
│   ├── Services/
│   │   └── PluginManager.cs
│   │
│   └── Domain/                  ← optional DDD core

```

# 🔌 3. Define the Plugin Contract

This is the **core of everything**:

```csharp
public interface IPlugin
{
    string Name { get; }
    string[] Dependencies { get; }

    void RegisterServices(IServiceCollection services);
    void MapEndpoints(IEndpointRouteBuilder endpoints);
}
```

### 💡 What this gives you:

* `RegisterServices` → inject services into DI
* `MapEndpoints` → expose APIs/routes
* `Dependencies` → solve plugin dependency problem (we’ll use this soon)

---

# ⚙️ 4. Example Plugin

```csharp
public class StripePlugin : IPlugin
{
    public string Name => "Stripe";
    public string[] Dependencies => new string[] { };

    public void RegisterServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddScoped<IPaymentService, StripePaymentService>();
    }

    public void MapEndpoints(IEndpointRouteBuilder endpoints)
    {
        endpoints.MapPost("/stripe/pay", async (IPaymentService service) =>
        {
            return await service.Pay();
        });
    }
}
```

---

# 🧠 5. Plugin Manager (Core Logic)

This is where:

* Plugins are loaded
* Dependencies are resolved
* Only enabled plugins are activated per client

```csharp
public class PluginManager
{
    private readonly List<IPlugin> _plugins;

    public PluginManager(IEnumerable<IPlugin> plugins)
    {
        _plugins = plugins.ToList();
    }

    public IEnumerable<IPlugin> ResolveForClient(Client client)
    {
        var enabled = _plugins
            .Where(p => client.EnabledPlugins.Contains(p.Name))
            .ToList();

        return ResolveDependencies(enabled);
    }

    private IEnumerable<IPlugin> ResolveDependencies(List<IPlugin> plugins)
    {
        var resolved = new List<IPlugin>();

        foreach (var plugin in plugins)
        {
            AddWithDependencies(plugin, plugins, resolved);
        }

        return resolved;
    }

    private void AddWithDependencies(
        IPlugin plugin,
        List<IPlugin> all,
        List<IPlugin> resolved)
    {
        if (resolved.Contains(plugin)) return;

        foreach (var dep in plugin.Dependencies)
        {
            var dependency = all.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Name == dep);
            if (dependency == null)
                throw new Exception($"Missing dependency: {dep}");

            AddWithDependencies(dependency, all, resolved);
        }

        resolved.Add(plugin);
    }
}
```

---

# 👥 6. Per-Client Configuration

Store this in DB:

```json
{
  "ClientA": ["Stripe", "Analytics"],
  "ClientB": ["PayPal"]
}
```

At runtime:

* Identify tenant (via subdomain, header, JWT, etc.)
* Load enabled plugins for that client

---

# 🚦 7. Wire It in ASP.NET Core Pipeline

In `Program.cs`:

```csharp
var plugins = app.Services.GetRequiredService<PluginManager>();
var client = GetCurrentClient(); // your logic

var activePlugins = plugins.ResolveForClient(client);

foreach (var plugin in activePlugins)
{
    plugin.MapEndpoints(app);
}
```

---

# 🔗 8. Handling Plugin Dependencies (Your Key Question)

## ✅ Case: Plugin depends on another plugin

Example:

```csharp
public class AdvancedAnalyticsPlugin : IPlugin
{
    public string Name => "AdvancedAnalytics";

    public string[] Dependencies => new[] { "Analytics" };
}
```

### What happens:

* If client enables `AdvancedAnalytics`
* But NOT `Analytics`

👉 System will:

* Either **auto-load dependency**
* OR **throw error** (better for control)

---

## 🧠 Best Practice

Choose one:

### Option A — Auto-resolve (recommended for UX)

* Automatically include dependencies

### Option B — Strict mode

* Fail fast if dependency missing

---

# 🧱 9. Stronger Design (Real-world improvement)

Instead of `string[] Dependencies`, use:

```csharp
Type[] Dependencies { get; }
```

This avoids typo bugs.

---

# 🔥 10. Advanced ASP.NET Techniques

### ✔️ Load plugins from assemblies dynamically

Using:

* `Assembly.LoadFrom()`
* or `ApplicationPartManager`

### ✔️ Isolate plugins

* Each plugin = separate Class Library

### ✔️ Feature flags per client

Use:

* Microsoft.FeatureManagement

# 🧭 11. Where is everything?

| Concept               | Location                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Plugin interface      | `Core/Abstractions/IPlugin.cs`  |
| Plugins               | `Plugins/*`                     |
| Dependency logic      | `PluginManager`                 |
| Per-client config     | DB / `TenantConfigRepository`   |
| Domain (optional DDD) | `Core/Domain` or inside plugins |

---

# ⚠️ Real-world pitfalls

* Circular dependencies between plugins ❌
* Versioning conflicts ❌
* Too many cross-plugin calls ❌ (breaks modularity)
* Plugins accessing DB directly (breaks boundaries) ❌

---

# 🧠 Simple mental model

* **ASP.NET DI = plugin backbone**
* **Middleware / endpoints = plugin surface**
* **PluginManager = brain**
* **Tenant config = switchboard**

---

# Cloud vs On-Premise

Good—this is where things get *real-world practical*. Short answer:

> Yes, the plugin approach works **both in cloud and on-premise**.
> But “**compile DLLs based on features**” is a *different strategy* from runtime plugins.

Let’s break it down clearly.

---

# 🧭 1. Cloud vs On-Premise (Important distinction)

### ✅ What you described earlier (PluginManager, dynamic loading):

* Works great in **cloud SaaS**
* Also works **on-premise**, *if you allow dynamic loading of DLLs*

👉 BUT many on-prem customers want:

* No dynamic loading ❌
* Fully controlled binaries ✅
* Security review of shipped DLLs ✅

So you often switch to:

> 👉 **Build-time composition instead of runtime plugins**

---

# 🏗️ 2. Strategy: Compile DLLs Based on Features

Instead of:

```
App loads plugins dynamically
```

You do:

```
Each customer gets a CUSTOM BUILD
```

---

# 🧱 3. Approach #1 — Separate Projects per Feature (Most Common)

### Structure:

```id="a1"
/src
│
├── Core/
│
├── Feature.Payments.Stripe/      ← separate project (DLL)
├── Feature.Payments.PayPal/
├── Feature.Analytics/
│
├── App.Host/                    ← main ASP.NET app
│   └── App.Host.csproj
```

---

### In `App.Host.csproj`:

For **Client A**:

```xml id="a2"
<ItemGroup>
  <ProjectReference Include="..\Feature.Payments.Stripe\Feature.Payments.Stripe.csproj" />
  <ProjectReference Include="..\Feature.Analytics\Feature.Analytics.csproj" />
</ItemGroup>
```

For **Client B**:

```xml id="a3"
<ItemGroup>
  <ProjectReference Include="..\Feature.Payments.PayPal\Feature.Payments.PayPal.csproj" />
</ItemGroup>
```

👉 So each build includes **only selected features**

---

### 🔍 Where are plugins here?

* Each `Feature.*` project = **plugin (but compiled-in)**

👉 This is often called:

> **Modular Monolith (Compile-time plugins)**

---

# ⚙️ 4. How Features Register Themselves

Inside each feature:

```csharp id="a4"
public static class StripeModule
{
    public static IServiceCollection AddStripe(this IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddScoped<IPaymentService, StripePaymentService>();
        return services;
    }
}
```

---

In `Program.cs` (per build):

```csharp id="a5"
builder.Services.AddStripe();
builder.Services.AddAnalytics();
```

👉 These calls only exist if the project is referenced.

---

# 🔁 5. Automating Per-Client Builds

You don’t want to manually edit `.csproj` every time.

### Option A — Build Configurations

```xml id="a6"
<PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)'=='ClientA'">
  <DefineConstants>CLIENT_A</DefineConstants>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Then:

```csharp id="a7"
#if CLIENT_A
builder.Services.AddStripe();
#endif
```

---

### Option B — Separate Host Projects (Cleaner)

```id="a8"
/App.Host.ClientA/
/App.Host.ClientB/
```

Each references different features.

👉 This is **very common in enterprise on-prem systems**

---

# 📦 6. Approach #2 — MSBuild Feature Flags (Advanced)

You can conditionally include projects:

```xml id="a9"
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(EnableStripe)'=='true'">
  <ProjectReference Include="..\Feature.Payments.Stripe\Feature.Payments.Stripe.csproj" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Build like:

```bash id="a10"
dotnet build -p:EnableStripe=true -p:EnableAnalytics=true
```

---

# 🔌 7. What About Dependencies Between Features?

Same idea as plugins, but **at build time**.

### Example:

`Feature.AdvancedAnalytics` depends on `Feature.Analytics`

👉 In `.csproj`:

```xml id="a11"
<ProjectReference Include="..\Feature.Analytics\Feature.Analytics.csproj" />
```

👉 This ensures:

* Compile-time safety ✅
* No missing dependencies at runtime ✅

---

# ⚠️ 8. Trade-offs (Very Important)

## ✅ Compile-time (on-prem friendly)

**Pros:**

* Secure (no runtime loading)
* Smaller deployment
* Easier debugging

**Cons:**

* Requires rebuild per client
* Less flexible

---

## ✅ Runtime plugins (cloud-friendly)

**Pros:**

* Add features without redeploy
* Dynamic per-tenant

**Cons:**

* More complex
* Security concerns

---

# 🧠 9. Hybrid Model (Used in Real Systems)

Many systems do:

* Compile-time modules (major features)
* Runtime flags (enable/disable per client)

Example:

* Stripe DLL is included
* But enabled only for some clients via config

---

# 🧭 10. Mental Model

| Approach             | When to use        |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Runtime plugins      | SaaS / cloud       |
| Compile-time modules | On-prem            |
| Hybrid               | Enterprise systems |

---

# 🔥 Key Insight

> You don’t actually “compile plugins dynamically” in .NET
> 👉 You either:

* **Load DLLs dynamically** (runtime plugins)
* OR
* **Decide which DLLs to include at build time**

---

# On-off Features Based on a Table

There’s a hard truth first:

> If a customer fully controls an **on-prem database**, you can’t *guarantee* they won’t change data.
> You can only **make it very hard, detectable, or pointless**.

So the solution is not just “protect the table”—it’s **defense in depth**.

Let’s walk through practical options (from strongest to weakest in real-world reliability).

---

# 🧱 1. First: Your Current Idea (Features Table)

```sql
Features
--------
ClientId
FeatureName
IsEnabled
```

This is fine for:

* Feature toggles
* Gradual rollout

👉 But by itself, it is **NOT secure** in on-prem.

---

# 🔐 2. Option A — Lock It at Database Level (Baseline Protection)

### Use:

* **Separate DB user for your app**
* Remove write permissions

```sql
DENY INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON Features TO app_user;
```

Only allow:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON Features TO app_user;
```

---

### Problem ❌

The client (DBA) can still:

* Change permissions
* Update data directly

👉 So this is **good hygiene**, not real protection.

---

# 🔏 3. Option B — Move Feature Control Outside the DB (Better)

Instead of trusting the DB:

### Store features in:

* Signed config file
* License file
* External service (if possible)

---

## Example: License File (Common in on-prem systems)

```json
{
  "client": "ACME",
  "features": ["Stripe", "Analytics"],
  "expiry": "2026-12-31",
  "signature": "BASE64_SIGNATURE"
}
```

---

### In your app:

* Verify signature using public key
* Reject if tampered

👉 This is **much stronger than DB**

---

### 🔐 Why this works

Client can:

* Edit file ❌ (breaks signature)
* Re-sign ❌ (no private key)

---

# 🧠 4. Option C — Combine DB + Signature (Best Practical Approach)

Keep your table, but add **tamper detection**:

```sql
Features
--------
FeatureName
IsEnabled
Signature
```

Signature is generated from:

```
hash(ClientId + FeatureName + IsEnabled + secret)
```

---

### In your app:

```csharp
if (!IsValidSignature(feature))
{
    throw new SecurityException("Feature tampering detected");
}
```

---

### 🔥 Result:

* Client edits DB → signature breaks → feature ignored

---

# 🔑 5. Option D — Encrypt Feature Values

Store:

```sql
EncryptedValue = AES(feature data)
```

App:

* Decrypts using embedded key

---

### Problem ❌

* Key is inside your app → can be reverse-engineered

👉 Only slows attackers, doesn’t stop them.

---

# 🧱 6. Option E — Code-Level Enforcement (CRITICAL)

Never rely only on data.

Instead of:

```csharp
if (feature.IsEnabled)
{
    DoSomething();
}
```

Do:

```csharp
if (!FeatureGuard.IsEnabled("Stripe"))
    throw new UnauthorizedAccessException();
```

Centralize logic:

```csharp
public class FeatureGuard
{
    public static bool IsEnabled(string feature)
    {
        // Validate signature + config + fallback
    }
}
```

---

# 🚨 7. What You CANNOT Prevent (Be Honest)

On-prem client can always:

* Modify DB ✅
* Patch your DLLs ✅
* Decompile your code ✅

👉 So your goal is:

> ❗ **Make tampering expensive and detectable—not impossible**

---

# 🧭 8. Real-World Strategy (Used in Enterprise)

Best setup looks like:

### ✅ 1. Compile-time features (major modules)

* Don’t ship code for disabled features

### ✅ 2. License file (signed)

* Controls what’s allowed

### ✅ 3. DB table (optional)

* Runtime toggles only

### ✅ 4. Server-side validation

* Always enforce in code

---

# 🧩 9. Practical Recommendation for YOU

Since you said:

> “App already built, hard to revamp”

👉 Do this minimal upgrade:

### Step 1 — Keep your `Features` table

### Step 2 — Add signature column

### Step 3 — Add validation layer

### Step 4 — Deny DB write permissions

---

# 🔥 Example Final Flow

1. App reads feature from DB
2. Validates signature
3. If invalid → disable feature + log
4. FeatureGuard enforces everywhere

---

# 🧠 Mental Model

* DB = **storage (not trusted)**
* Code = **enforcement**
* Signature = **integrity**

---

# ⚡ One blunt insight

> If a customer is determined enough, they can bypass anything on-prem.

So the real question is:

* Are you protecting against **accidental misuse**? ✅ (easy)
* Or **malicious tampering**? ⚠️ (only partially possible)

---

If you want, I can:

* write a **ready-to-use C# implementation** for signed features
* or show how licensing systems (like in enterprise .NET apps) are typically built end-to-end.

# ⚖️ Cloud vs On-Prem Strategy

| Aspect                   | Cloud (SaaS)              | On-Prem                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Feature delivery         | Runtime plugins           | Compile-time features            |
| Deployment               | One build for all clients | Custom build per client          |
| Flexibility              | High (enable anytime)     | Low (requires rebuild)           |
| Security                 | Medium (dynamic loading)  | High (fixed binaries)            |
| Typical ASP.NET approach | DI + PluginManager        | ProjectReference + build configs |

---

# 🧠 Final Mental Model

* **Monolith** → how you *deploy*
* **DDD** → how you *organize logic*
* **Plugins** → how you *extend features*
